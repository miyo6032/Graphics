hw5: Lighting

CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2019

Demonstrates Gourand shading as explained in class on a non-convex isosphere.
This is difficult because the normal method of shading a scaled sphere
fails when the sphere is warped to the point where it is no longer convex.

While this doesn't mimic reality perfectly (for example, one bump is not
aware of the other bump in front of it. I assume raycasting is required for that), 
it is better than the scaled sphere shading in that the normals all point in the 
correct direction of the surface, and the shading looks natural.

Custom Controls:
  c          Toggles whether normals are drawn as lines on the object [Porcupine Mode]
  v          Change number of subvisions of the object

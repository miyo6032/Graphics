Project Requirements
    [DONE] Basic 3d spring rendering though a loadable network [EASY]
        Spheres and lines [CYLINDERS ARE UNECESSARY]

    [DONE] Color based on data or based on a given partition [EASY]

    [DONE] Highlighting motifs [EASY]
        Find the different motifs and highlight them
        Should be a simple extension of the color

    [DONE] Implementing actual partition algorithm [EASY]

    Transparency of nodes and edges [Moderate]

    [DONE] Bloom effect [LOL REKT]

    glutWarpPointer doesn't seem to work on linux

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Finish ^ by 11/16 (If we aren't close, we have problems)

    Selection of nodes [Hard]
        Edit properies of a node
        Minimal interface
        
    Fog/cloud effect for partitions (I really want to try my hand at this) [Hard]

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Finish ^ by 11/23

    Showing flow through a directed network much like in PS8 [Hard]

    Real time moving and floating (depends on networkx efficiency) [Hard]

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Finish by 11/30

    Creating the presentation I guess [Easy]

    Final project adjustments

    Write the paper 

|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Finish by December 5, 10, and 16 respectively

Optional
    Translucent surface wrapping around different communities (Depends on a lot the wrapping algorithm and how well we can do communities) [Hard]
    Topilogical rendering of a 2d network [Hard]

2 weeks from now
Project Progress Report is November 9th, where we want to have the base application already done.

Class project review is is about 5 weeks away, December 1.

The project presentation for bio networks starts December 2.

The project is about 6 weeks away (December 10).

The paper for bio networks is December 16.
